# react-hooks-todo

## What is this?
I wanted to see what all the hubub was about with React Hooks, so I made a full-featured todo app that uses the following hooks:

- useState
- useRef
- useContext
- useEffect
- useReducer

## What's the verdict?
I really enjoyed using hooks. The syntax requirements feel closer to pure Javascript than I was initially expecting, and it's definitely a lot easier to reason about the functionality of the app.

## Demo
